# Task 2: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiment from social media posts, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to determine public opinion on various topics.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Dataset with social media posts and sentiment labels.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for text preprocessing, training, and sentiment prediction.

## Key Files
- `preprocess_text.py`: Script for cleaning and processing text data.
- `train_sentiment_model.py`: Model training on labeled data.
- `predict_sentiment.py`: Predicts sentiment on new text data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow/keras

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and prepare data with `preprocess_text.py`.
2. **Train Model**: Train a sentiment model using `train_sentiment_model.py`.
3. **Predict**: Use `predict_sentiment.py` for real-time sentiment analysis on new text.

## Results
Summarize performance metrics, like accuracy or F1-score, to validate model effectiveness.
