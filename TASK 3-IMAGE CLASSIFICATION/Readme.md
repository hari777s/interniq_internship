# Task 3: Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images into different categories using machine learning. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns and classify images accurately.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset for training and testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and testing.

## Key Files
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Prepares and augments image data.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the CNN model.
- `predict_image.py`: Script for classifying new images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: tensorflow, keras, numpy, opencv-python

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Images**: Use `data_preprocessing.py` to prepare images.
2. **Train Model**: Run `train_model.py` to build the model.
3. **Predict**: Classify new images with `predict_image.py`.

## Results
Provide accuracy, loss graphs, and sample predictions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome via issues or pull requests.
